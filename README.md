# AI-Virtual-Assistant
An interactive AI-powered virtual assistant developed in Python for the Applied Natural Language Processing (CAI 451) Lab #10.

An interactive AI-powered virtual assistant developed in Python for the Applied Natural Language Processing Lab (CAI 451).
It performs multiple intelligent tasks including:

- Translating English text to Arabic using Google Translate API.

- Retrieving the latest global news headlines via the News API.

- Fetching real-time flight details using the Aviation Stack API.

- Reading news headlines aloud using text-to-speech (gTTS).

Built to demonstrate practical integration of translation, information retrieval, and speech synthesis techniques, this project highlights the use of APIs, NLP, and audio interaction in a cohesive assistant system.
